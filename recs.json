(Later, I found out my brother had originated this rumor, lol). As I was coming to terms with going home and to bed without plans I walked past a line of people waiting to be let into the Comedy Cellar on MacDougal street. Without thinking, I bought a ticket, let the bouncer put my phone in a sealed up package, and got a little anxious. But, what transpired in that basement theater was the best way to re-acquaint myself with live performance. The comedians were geniuses and fearless. Nothing was off-limits. From some of the comedians's comments I gathered the late show has a freedom the earlier audiences do not always allow. Well my late-night audience was ready for anything and the energy was unreal. I left that basement at 2am feeling full and hopeful; face hurting from laughter. I'll be getting off work again and going straight to the Comedy Cellar for some great comedy soon. Oh boy, wow, I do love jokes! ",

If you follow Alex on IG you probably already know he has a series of frequently updated (and fantastic) playlists on his Spotify, but did you know that next week he’s dropping a brand new radio show called “Sound Radio”? Yup! And on this show you can expect to find artists, designers, writers, chefs, winemakers, architects, photographers, and musicians sharing songs they love— you can check out the show on Anchor, Spotify, or Apple Music! Alex clearly has great taste and lucky for us, he’s here to talk about what he’s been into.",

But my buddy Joel, a fantastic furniture designer, did. He told me the first time he went, as a teenager, he was standing in line outside, hoping to get in, and an elegant lady stepped out of the club wearing a silk gown, smoking, walking a ferret on a leash. That’s how he knew he was in the right place.\n\nD’Agostino wears a lot of hats. Often he dresses like a pilot. He’s been a mega Italo disco star since the Eighties, his music gives the feeling of driving around Tuscany at sunset in a sports car. His “Bitter Sweet Symphony” is sublime.

But my buddy Joel, a fantastic <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ls.gomma/\">furniture designer</a>, did. He told me the first time he went, as a teenager, he was standing in line outside, hoping to get in, and an elegant lady stepped out of the club wearing a silk gown, smoking, walking a ferret on a leash. That’s how he knew he was in the right place.</p><p>D’Agostino wears a lot of hats. Often he dresses like a pilot. He’s been a mega Italo disco star since the Eighties, his music gives the feeling of driving around Tuscany at sunset in a sports car.

What von Hardenberg really longs for however isn’t Sophie, but the “blue flower” he’s writing about. Some lines from the story he reads aloud:\n\n“I have no craving to be rich, but I long to see the blue flower. It lies incessantly at my heart, and I can imagine and think about nothing else. Never did I feel like this before. It is as if until now I had been dreaming, or as if sleep had carried me into another world.”\n\nThe blue flower is what he’s been searching for his entire life but cannot find, will never find.\n\nWhat it represents is not explained. It might be understood as a perfect moment of transcendental joy; or the Great Beauty, or the writing that gives meaning to life, the hope, which destroys us, the trembling, skipping longing for the infinite. The flower is different for all of us. The blue has never been seen. We could do with more vaulting romanticism I feel.\n\n“The universe, after all,” thinks Friedrich, “is within us.”",

Covering or blowing out candles after you're done with them will replace your beautifully scented candle with the smell of smoke, so why bother even getting a scented candle?! Another thing that most people don't know is that you should keep your wicks trimmed so that the flame doesn't get too big. This will lead to black flames which will stain the side of the glass. My candle purchases are mostly because of the scent, but the other reason for me is the jar that it comes in. So taking care of my candle means that I'll have a cleaner, re-usable jar once I'm done with it :)",

Before theaters were open, Nitehawk was delivering their popcorn, and I would actually spend $15 and order this to my apartment because it’s the best. But go to the actual theater since it’s open now and order this popcorn! Devour it before the movie even starts! Order another bowl of it! Relish in the stomachache afterwards!

I recommend the documentary, seriously, titled “Beautiful Noise” by Eric Green. The film retrospectively examines three fundamental  rock bands—Cocteau Twins, The Jesus and Mary Chain, and My Bloody Valentine—and their influence on shoegazing and other alternative rock genres. Another great documentary on Slowdive in particular, is Pitchfork Classic’s: Slowdive - Souvlaki, which covers the history of the band prior to their biggest record, the negative reception from critics, and their legacy.  ",

My friend Timmy and I have sent each other videos of them literally every single day since 2019, and have watched Kintaro grow from a useless baby into a little rascal who can hold his own against his big brother Gentaro. Momotaro grew up without a father, and watching him  learn the ropes of fatherhood with Kintaro was one of the most beautiful character arc’s I’ve ever seen. I strongly urge you tp follow accounts related to the Momotaro family and watch videos of them on Youtube. Please be nice as this is a subject dear to my heart.",

When my wife and I moved, we did it all — upgraded the mattress to a king-sized mail-in foam mattress, tossed that onto a nice natural wood platform frame, and (the cherry on top), spruced the whole situation up with some linen bedding. Most of what I love about the linen bedding comes from the look. It looks lived in but still luxurious, like it cost 2+ times the price of normal cotton sheets (ok they do, but worth it!!!) Beyond the aesthetic wins, are even more benefits. The linen (at least on our set) is dirt repellent, strong, and softens over time for actual years. We went with the Tuft & Needle sheet set because we bought that mattress, but I’ve heard great things about Parachute too.",

As it turns out, the recipe is as easy as advertised, and more delicious than I imagined. It’s so basic but so good, one of those recipes that takes hours to complete but only actually requires hands-on interaction or attention for minutes. Since my first try, I’ve made a no-knead loaf maybe 10 times and have started to experiment with different varieties (honey oat 😍).

This is one of those high school curriculum books that a lot of people have “read” but most of them haven’t really read it. This book is an anti-war book without being an in-your-face anti-war book. Written by a German soldier from WWI, about German soldiers in WWI, it’s real and HARSH. The contrast of what these young teens expected when enlisting (heroism, glory!) to what they really experience (disease, death, trench foot) is shocking and ultimately very sad. All Quiet on the Western Front is a heavy read but so worth it, it’s a classic for a reason.",

And if you’d rather watch your food content, she has a weekly show on Youtube called “Home Movies”, where she cooks many of the recipes from her newsletter. Roman is also working on her third cookbook, which will be focused on desserts, sweet things, and baked goods for people who don’t necessarily like desserts, sweet things, or baking— keep an eye out for updates on her IG!

I don't feel bad plugging this series because it’s free and the mixes are by other people than myself. I don’t think I could host a podcast so this scratches the itch of inviting interesting people to contribute to something beyond my regular job, and its also purely for fun. Music discovery is one of life’s great gifts. A good new song can make your week, and a good mix can make your day. This series is also a love letter to the Mixtape. I still think a hand-cranked mix is one of the greatest DIY projects as far low-effort satisfaction on both ends of the chain. I’m not anti-algo on the whole, it has a place, but you can feel it when someone puts time into making a great mix.",

He used to pick me up from the mall in eighth grade blasting Pharaoh Sanders or Maynard Ferguson, and when I got in, instead of turning it down, he would turn it up and say, “LISTEN TO THIS, MOUSE!!! JEEZ!!” Anyways: I first fell in love with Albert Ayler when I saw the 2013 Whitney exhibition Blues for Smoke, and on the ground floor--this is when the museum was still in the Breuer--they were playing this beautiful film of Ayler performing “Spirits Rejoice”--I think on French television. It’s very bizarre, very classic Ayler--it starts and stops multiple times, it mocks its source material, it discharges it into ecstasy. He’s like...the Herodotus of jazz. You can hear Louis Armstrong as much as you can hear Pharaoh Sanders. Ayler had one of the most fascinating lives. It was far too short: he died at 34, and there were rumors for decades that the mafia murdered him by tying him to a jukebox and throwing it into the East River. \n\nWhere to start? Well, his version of “On Green Dolphin Street” is one of the craziest things you’ll ever hear. Same goes with “Summertime.” And his live recordings are W-I-L-D: try “Live At Greenwich Village.” You can practically hear the paint peeling off the walls during “Truth Is Marching In.”\n\nI think there’s this idea that free jazz was somehow inevitable, the same way that Abstract Expressionism was--that it was simply the logical endpoint of the art form. I don’t think that’s quite right. There’s an album called The Albert Ayler Story, which is like an audio documentary and which I also recommend a lot, in which there are lots of interviews with Ayler and friends, plus formative recordings. And his drummer Milford Graves talks how there was a movement in the 1960s to stop jazz music--specifically Pharaoh and Sun-Ra and Ayler--because the musicians were too involved in political activism. Critics said it had nothing to do with the music. But to Graves, this free or avant-garde jazz was always about political progress, because it allows you to have “abstract thoughts” that you later “condense” into something “more logical.” He says of the work he was making and would have continued to make with Ayler, who died in 1970: “I think the music was going to direct people into another area of consciousness.” That’s what was lost when Ayler died. Whereas in something like pop music, “you’re constantly moving around in a circle, where there’s no kind of opening out. You’re caught.” Isn’t that fascinating?",

Sometimes tunnel vision can really lead you astray so it’s always best to be searching with an open mind. I’ve had a hard time with reading since quarantine, I think it has something to do with an exorbitant amount of screen time destroying what was left of my spreading diminished attention span. I trudged through book after book this past year not being able to sink my teeth into anything until I found Parable of the Sower. This book has made me fall in love with reading again. Instead of rewatching the Sopranos for the millionth time, I look forward to my time each day with the book’s chronicler, Lauren Olamina, and her Earthseed musings. A novel fraught with dystopia that feels more like today’s news than the science fiction label it got when published in 1993. I haven’t finished it quite yet, but I have been telling everyone they should read it, truly inspiring and makes me want to approach each day with more empathy and hope no matter how much despair we are hit with each day. God is Change.",

After some taste tests, I adopted Cool Cucumber like it was my newborn son.  Over the past two or three years the fun Juul flavors have all been banned (Cool Cuke included) and I, like many others, have had to venture into the wild west of smoke lottos to find flavored disposable alternatives.  Most are disgusting but you don’t know what you’re going to get until you drop $8-$15 and take the first puff.  Air Bar Lux’s are built better, hit better and taste better than any disposable vape you’ll find at the shop - the Dyson, the iPhone 4S of nicotine delivery systems.",

Curious and enamored with the stylish plating of the acai, I asked for a cheeky bite. Needless to say, I was delighted. It was sugary sweet and refreshing, but was disguised in a health fad facade. The next day I got my very own acai bowl, which was too big and I couldn’t finish it, (cookie breakfast fit much easier on an adderall stomach) So I stuffed it in my fridge to munch on later. To my surprise the bowl congealed during its refrigerated hours into a delicious mush like gruel of granola and almond butter and fruit. I was comforted by the baby food esk consistency of the concoction, charmed by the banana now coated in toppings, my palette purred at the way the now frozen almond butter was washed down by the melted acai.

It was very Sex and The City meets effortless chic ambient television and 20 years ago I wondered why I had such a crush on this woman. Watching it now, the recipes are a bit outdated and she uses this giant two-handed Medieval weapon to chop her parsley which didn’t age well, but the overall message she’s attempting to convey does. I yearn for a time in the food world where we weren’t all so concerned with finding the next new thing to post about and could just enjoy the simplicity of things. One time I was at the now-shuttered LA restaurant “Trois Mec” and I spotted Nigella having dinner with Anthony Bourdain. It made me wonder if they were always meant for each other, or just two old dogs from a bygone era trying to make sense of the new and confusing world of food. Plus, the handmade artwork is cute. The last era of television where people could kind of do what they wanted to do, hire their friends to help out, and not have data analytics drive the narrative.",

I got this blade as a gift from my friend Andre, and it never left my drawer. There’s good clearance between the handle and the blade so people with larger hands or fat fingers will have room to chop, the tip is rounded so when you’re slicing an avocado while it’s still in it’s skin, you won’t cut your hand open, spilling blood on your eggs, and there even a hole punched in the tip if you’re the kind of person who likes hanging things on the wall. Whenever I bring my knives in to get sharpened, this Mac blade is the only one that the sharpener man feels compelled to compliment, a knifeman’s knife if you will. Also, at a hundred bucks, it’s perfect for your daily driver knife, you won’t feel the need to baby it like some hand-pounded tech bro carbon steel with a dragon engraved in the handle.",

Now I can eagerly dive into another, knowing I have a meticulous breakdown and deep dive waiting for me on the other end.

He has been putting out consistent tracks throughout the years, I highly recommend listening to any of his albums he has put out, mainly because they're very similar in terms of production and vibe.

In Islands of Fire, you see a small village nestled at the mercy of an active volcano, and what they go through when that volcano acts up.

I spontaneously walked into L'Occitane recently and it was the best decision that I've made this winter. I picked up their Néroli & Orchidée, Cherry Blossom, and Shea Butter hand cream and they were all great!! My hands are now healing and no more clammy feeling :)",

It's a lot thicker than the regular Oatly milk you're probably used to, but I honestly think it might be better than real milk. It also goes super well with baked goods if it isn't too thick for you.

If I had to choose, his album Let’s Stay Together is one of my favorites (along with Kind of Blue (1959) by Miles Davis). I’ll stop writing here because I would prefer you play the album while you read the rest of this newsletter.",

These eye-catching creations have landed her major collaborations with the likes of Crocs, Puma, Opening Ceremony, Reebok, Foot Locker, Prada, and more.

I heard a podcast once, I couldn’t find it for this, talking about the power going slow, of Turtle medicine. Going slow is an antidote to the intensity and stress that hits us all day long in the whirlpool of capitalism. I moved away last year and am trying to make an effort to slow down. A great way to consciously slow down is to focus on walking slowly. When I can successfully catch myself, my whole mentality shifts. I realize I can breathe and my shoulders drop. I create additional tension for myself when I rush. I found this popular Ted Talk on Slowness that demonstrates how going slow can transform our daily lives for the better. Stop and smell the roses. ",

Is he talking about his recreational drug use or the passing of his father - who died from a blood clot when he was 11 years old - or his wife Kate Radley's father, who died of cancer? Probably all three. Ashcroft still plays solo but doesn't perform this song. This is the best version I have ever found online—a masterpiece. ",

Even if you don't feel like committing to the whole thing, pick a few chapters and read ‘em!</p>",

I’ve switched over to dried mango, coconut, and other fruit from TJs, but couldn’t resist this candied Yuzu when I came across it. Yuzu has such a vibrant citrus flavor that when candied, lends some sweetness to an otherwise bitter rind, resulting in a beautiful depth and zestful flavor.

Through Instagram, I’ve been discovering so many different styles and designs that I began cataloging some of my favorites and booking appointments with other artists. It’s been a great way for me to stay social during quarantine while supporting local artists in the community. Tattoos are an expensive hobby and aesthetically aren’t for everybody, but I found they help me feel more comfortable in my body and from a styling perspective they help accentuate the more minimal outfits I find myself wearing lately.

I only light it when I’m feeling EXTRA homesick for Los Angeles because I want it to last forever (I’ve actually burned through 3 of them at this point).",

When released in theaters the movie Originally deemed “too controversial, and likely to incite racial tension” and was given a “X” rating. Funny enough it was finally released in the US in 2019 right in the midst of our own racial reckoning. Right now more than ever Babylon feels very close to home. I highly recommend the watch, Plus the music in the film is sooo damn good!!",

The show is basically about a bunch of young, hot people who all “suck at relationships” and are trying to find their Perfect Match: another contestant on the show, predetermined by the producers but unknown amongst themselves, who is meant to be their ideal romantic partner. I’m in it for the shitty laser effects, the snarky host Ryan Devlin, and of course, the never-ending drama.

The essence of the book is how women regain their wild intuition in the context of a patriarchal culture that strips it.

No offense, but the VFX-driven spectacles of today just don’t hit when you cut your teeth on stuff from CANADA and the Directors Bureau (whose website sadly doesn’t even have their best stuff anymore). \n\nThe unique exception is director Cody Critcheloe, who goes by SSION (pronounced like the latter half of *passion*), and his new video for Yves Tumor is nothing less than what I’ve come to expect from the multihyphenate: a hyperreal vision of Los Angeles replete with larger-than-life characters who are characteristically drawn up from real life, and handmade props that belong in a museum, but I’ll settle for a gallery. (In this case, it’s a smashed-up hand-painted sunburst convertible and a leather jacket with a The Cochran Firm logo.)

Mac's production here is classic and timeless, sounding just as grimy, blingy, and fresh listening today as it did in 2013.

Faccia Brutto is a Brooklyn-based spirits company and the fernet is perfect for sipping with some soda water after a long day. There is less alcoholic heat and more depth of flavor from this Fernet than most others. It is life-affirming after a big meal and while I drink it as a spritz you could have it on the rocks or straight.

You follow the story of a man who has nothing left in life to bring him joy except his newfound passion for fishing. What starts out as a heartwarming story of overcoming depression and loss quickly evolves into the dark & twisting tale of “Dutchman’s Creek” and the checkered history surrounding it. This was a pretty long listen, but I couldn’t get enough of it. ",

Fair warning, the combination of the garlic and Thai chili will uppercut your nostrils the minute it hits the pan, but it’s well worth the pain. </p><p>This nostalgic dish’s aroma takes me back to the sidewalks of an Southeast Asian food stall, best paired with a cold glass of Singha 😉🍻 </p>",
