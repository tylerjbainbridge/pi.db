A great way to consciously slow down is to focus on walking slowly. When I can successfully catch myself, my whole mentality shifts. I realize I can breathe and my shoulders drop.

I haven't tried Headspace personally, but I've heard mixed reviews where it has or hasn't worked. I feel like anything that lives in my phone is an automatic distraction for me. I personally started meditating through a book recommended by a friend, The Miracle of Mindfulness, written by Thich Nhat Hanh, a world-renowned monk who is also a peace activist. What really reeled me in was that it covered the whys in why we meditate, and it inspired me to learn more and practice it everyday. Whether you've unsuccessfully trialed meditation or haven't at all, I highly recommend learning to meditate through a book like this one :)",

The film follows Blue, a young Jamaican man and his friends as he pursues his music career while dealing with the realness of racism and xenophobia. When released in theaters the movie Originally deemed ‚Äútoo controversial, and likely to incite racial tension‚Äù and was given a ‚ÄúX‚Äù rating.

This isn't to say I didn't see the twist coming, but it was done in a way that left plenty of good stuff to pick apart after you‚Äòve finished.</p>",

I actually DON‚ÄôT recommend anyone download Tik Tok - it‚Äôs confusing, scary and demented. Personally, I like all that kind of stuff (raised on a computer - i‚Äôve seen it all, I‚Äôm numb, jaded, etc) so this is how I can filter and showcase what I believe is the best of the best, which also usually happens to be the worst. I made this account in April to show my coworkers on How To my favorite Tik Toks I was finding without flooding the group chat (it was getting to be A LOT‚Ä¶).

I actually DON‚ÄôT recommend anyone download Tik Tok - it‚Äôs confusing, scary and demented. Personally, I like all that kind of stuff (raised on a computer - i‚Äôve seen it all, I‚Äôm numb, jaded, etc) so this is how I can filter and showcase what I believe is the best of the best, which also usually happens to be the worst. I made this account in April to show my coworkers on How To my favorite Tik Toks I was finding without flooding the group chat (it was getting to be A LOT‚Ä¶).

Either way, she's a beautiful Chinese princess (not really, but basically) that lives in rural China with her grandma (allegedly). Each episode she takes - usually like a fruit or vegetable that's in season - and makes a bunch of things from scratch using that main ingredient. The sounds are calming (chopping wood, puppies barking, wind), it's shot really beautifully and her skills are honestly really impressive. It's like girls and gay guy football...every time I have shared it, anytime she does something we scream. People doubt the authenticity of it - but I prefer not to.¬†\n\nThen there is SteveMRE1989 who is the coolest dude with the most swag on all of YouTube. He is obsessed with eating MREs from like any decade and country basically. His voice is so soothing and I love how he describes every part of the ration, sparing no detail, his way of saying \"Nice.\" I especially love when he gets cigarettes from like a WW1¬†MRE and smokes them on camera. He's the fucking best.¬†\n\nLast but not least is MadSeasonShow who is a guy who plays WoW. He has hour-long videos on the history of WoW and other stuff like that. His voice is literally the best and he is most often the channel I choose to fall asleep to because the videos also have really nice medieval¬†elevator¬†slow jams (hope that makes sense) in the background. He sometimes streams on Twitch as well and that's always a treat,¬†the way he says \"Doritos\" is mad cool. I think he's from Canada or the midwest somewhere.

Or that they were asked by the city to perform live in Central Park during the broadcast of the moon landing? For the unacquainted, Silver Apples were a duo that first brought oscillating electronic instruments from the sober and hyper-serious confines of academia and into rock n roll. The Velvets, The Dolls, The Ramones, Talking Heads, Run DMC, Biggie, Gershwin ‚Äî these acts are all etched into the city‚Äôs history. Silver Apples don‚Äôt enjoy the same proximity, likely because after only two relatively obscure albums, they were forced by PanAm to disband (long story, look it up!).

Or that they were asked by the city to perform live in Central Park during the broadcast of the moon landing? For the unacquainted, Silver Apples were a duo that first brought oscillating electronic instruments from the sober and hyper-serious confines of academia and into rock n roll. The Velvets, The Dolls, The Ramones, Talking Heads, Run DMC, Biggie, Gershwin ‚Äî these acts are all etched into the city‚Äôs history. Silver Apples don‚Äôt enjoy the same proximity, likely because after only two relatively obscure albums, they were forced by PanAm to disband (long story, look it up!). I think its time we carved the name Silver Apples into the Big Apple.&nbsp;</p>",

And back in 2017 he dropped Thawing Dawn, a solo record that I consider to be very underrated & I encourage everyone to check it out. Parquet Courts have a new album coming out this Friday (!) titled ‚ÄúSympathy For Life‚Äù and have released three killer singles ahead of its release. If you‚Äôre in Brooklyn you should totally snag some tickets to their album release show at the Music Hall of Williamsburg. A.

Each episode usually culminates with John and his family cooking their bounty over open fire on the beach, inspiring both mouthwatering envy and awe.

The original song with just Stormzy is fine, but only the remix by legendary grime producer Sir Spyro has the music video, and literally every second of it blows my mind. Why are Ed Sheeran and Stormzy driving a range rover through the English farmland in matching tracksuits? Why is Ed Sheeran rapping about ‚Äúgrossing half a billi on the divide tour‚Äù right after Stormzy‚Äôs talking about letting his 12 gauge rip? Why does Aitch‚Äôs verse in the video take place in a poorly lit cafe with Ed taking massive bites of his meal with a fork while the rest of the video is much more glamorous? Why is the hook so fucking good?? Give me a packet of crisps and a pint!! Please check this song out lol",

I still remember the stars from his other books: Katey Kontent, from rules of civility, climbing the social ladder in NYC (please read my rec for this book, to me its aged like fine wine & is solidified as one of my all-timers), and Count Rostov, from A Gentleman in Moscow, appreciating the small things in life: every detail. That in mind - it‚Äôs high praise when I say that Emmett, Duchess, Woolly, and Bobby may be the most memorable characters I‚Äôve experienced in a long time.

About 40 miles of the Appalachian Trail pass through the park, which boasts the trail-famous Lemon Squeezer obstacle.

It‚Äôs probably the only place where you can get mauled by a black bear while looking at the Empire State Building.

I've tried Jergens, Gold Bond, Aesop, and all that. It's been a rough winter and the excessive hand-washing and hand sanitizer has f**ked my hands up. I spontaneously walked into L'Occitane recently and it was the best decision that I've made this winter. I picked up their N√©roli & Orchid√©e, Cherry Blossom, and Shea Butter hand cream and they were all great!! My hands are now healing and no more clammy feeling :)",

It's a lot thicker than the regular Oatly milk you're probably used to, but I honestly think it might be better than real milk. It also goes super well with baked goods if it isn't too thick for you. Another plus is that this stuff can be shipped and doesn‚Äôt have to be refrigerated until it‚Äôs opened.",
