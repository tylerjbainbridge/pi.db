I've experimented so I can tell you that putting them in the freezer is the way to go. The chocolate hardens a bit but the rice cake stays the same (cardboard-y and delicious). The best way to enjoy them is to take two of them and - wait for it - put peanut butter in the middle. Hello, healthy peanut butter cup! I know it's not&nbsp;<em>actually&nbsp;</em>healthy, but it really does feel like a crunchy treat you'd find at, like, the farmer's market. They're good alone, too, so please don't think peanut butter is required in order to enjoy&nbsp;them. They come in a yellow package so they're hard to miss on&nbsp;the&nbsp;shelves. Pretty sure they're in the snack aisle. What am I saying? Trader Joe's is one big snack aisle.&nbsp;</p>",

            "content": "The Blue Flower, a short perfect novel by Penelope Fitzgerald, was published in London in 1995 when she was 78 years old. It‚Äôs a dramatization of Friedrich von Hardenberg‚Äôs years as a struggling writer and student, from 1790 to 1797, before he made a name for himself as romantic symbolist poet Novalis, and tells the story of his infatuation with the very ordinary, childish 12-year-old Sophie von K√ºhn. He meets her when he‚Äôs 22 and falls in mystical love at first sight with her. Like many powerful novels, it‚Äôs a book of longing. What von Hardenberg really longs for however isn‚Äôt Sophie, but the ‚Äúblue flower‚Äù he‚Äôs writing about. Some lines from the story he reads aloud:\n\n‚ÄúI have no craving to be rich, but I long to see the blue flower. It lies incessantly at my heart, and I can imagine and think about nothing else. Never did I feel like this before. It is as if until now I had been dreaming, or as if sleep had carried me into another world.‚Äù\n\nThe blue flower is what he‚Äôs been searching for his entire life but cannot find, will never find.\n\nWhat it represents is not explained. It might be understood as a perfect moment of transcendental joy; or the Great Beauty, or the writing that gives meaning to life, the hope, which destroys us, the trembling, skipping longing for the infinite. The flower is different for all of us. The blue has never been seen. We could do with more vaulting romanticism I feel.\n\n‚ÄúThe universe, after all,‚Äù thinks Friedrich, ‚Äúis within us.‚Äù",

Another thing that most people don't know is that you should keep your wicks trimmed so that the flame doesn't get too big. This will lead to black flames which will stain the side of the glass. My candle purchases are mostly because of the scent, but the other reason for me is the jar that it comes in.

This family in particular however, stole my heart from the beginning.¬†\n\nIt was April 2019. I discovered the Instagram account @genki_no_takaramono. Since I first laid eyes on Momotaro, 21, with his fluffy ass spread out on the floor, chilling in a very cool manner, I was sold. Later I found out, he has two sons. Gentaro, now 10 years old, and Kintaro, now 2 years old. Their mother is Genki, 36, and is an amazing mother. My friend Timmy and I have sent each other videos of them literally every single day since 2019, and have watched Kintaro grow from a useless baby into a little rascal who can hold his own against his big brother Gentaro. Momotaro grew up without a father, and watching him¬† learn the ropes of fatherhood with Kintaro was one of the most beautiful character arc‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever seen.

Gentaro, now 10 years old, and Kintaro, now 2 years old. Their mother is Genki, 36, and is an amazing mother.

The branding is terrible but it‚Äôs the best almond butter I‚Äôve ever had. It‚Äôs not too creamy or thick, filled with fine chunks of fresh almonds. When I returned home it was hard to find, so I ordered a case online.

This is one of those high school curriculum books that a lot of people have ‚Äúread‚Äù but most of them haven‚Äôt really read it. This book is an anti-war book without being an in-your-face anti-war book. Written by a German soldier from WWI, about German soldiers in WWI, it‚Äôs real and HARSH. The contrast of what these young teens expected when enlisting (heroism, glory!) to what they really experience (disease, death, trench foot) is shocking and ultimately very sad.

JEEZ!!‚Äù Anyways: I first fell in love with Albert Ayler when I saw the 2013 Whitney exhibition Blues for Smoke, and on the ground floor--this is when the museum was still in the Breuer--they were playing this beautiful film of Ayler performing ‚ÄúSpirits Rejoice‚Äù--I think on French television. It‚Äôs very bizarre, very classic Ayler--it starts and stops multiple times, it mocks its source material, it discharges it into ecstasy. He‚Äôs like...the Herodotus of jazz. You can hear Louis Armstrong as much as you can hear Pharaoh Sanders. Ayler had one of the most fascinating lives.

I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs quite right. There‚Äôs an album called The Albert Ayler Story, which is like an audio documentary and which I also recommend a lot, in which there are lots of interviews with Ayler and friends, plus formative recordings. And his drummer Milford Graves talks how there was a movement in the 1960s to stop jazz music--specifically Pharaoh and Sun-Ra and Ayler--because the musicians were too involved in political activism. Critics said it had nothing to do with the music. But to Graves, this free or avant-garde jazz was always about political progress, because it allows you to have ‚Äúabstract thoughts‚Äù that you later ‚Äúcondense‚Äù into something ‚Äúmore logical.‚Äù He says of the work he was making and would have continued to make with Ayler, who died in 1970: ‚ÄúI think the music was going to direct people into another area of consciousness.‚Äù That‚Äôs what was lost when Ayler died.

A novel fraught with dystopia that feels more like today‚Äôs news than the science fiction label it got when published in 1993.

When you‚Äôre in a bath you‚Äôve lovingly made for yourself, it‚Äôs like returning to the womb. It‚Äôs also a fraction of the cost of those sensory deprivation chambers. I get my deepest cries in the bath and my most valuable moments of clarity. Foot baths are also awesome if you don‚Äôt have a bath and they are quick to clean up. I even successfully got my surfer boyfriend hooked on post-ocean footbaths.</p>",

You can find it at most Asian grocery stores, but Amazon works too. Mix a can of Milkis with two (or three lol) shots of any Sake that you‚Äôd like (we like Tyku and Hakutsuru), and this becomes a dangerous weapon. It tastes so good that you barely taste the alcohol, but guaranteed to fuck you up. I really like how the Milkis makes the drink super creamy and the flavor is flexible depending on the kind of Milkis you pick up.",

Piker, a political commentator, streams every day to thousands of viewers and has been a great resource to help me learn more about leftist politics. For years, I found myself encapsulated in the ‚ÄúInstagram-activism‚Äù bubble while not really understanding the context and gravity of the things I was advocating for. I had good intentions, but if someone really dug into my positions I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to back them up confidently. Thanks to Piker, I believe I can articulate leftist talking points in a better manner while understanding the historical context and nuance that comes with them. It‚Äôs really important to understand how we‚Äôve gotten here as a country in order to advocate for the future, and I encourage people to reflect on their own beliefs and their ability to defend them. There‚Äôs always more to learn.",

Mac's production here is classic and timeless, sounding just as grimy, blingy, and fresh listening today as it did in 2013. This dropped before Vince really broke onto the scene with Hell Can Wait, but Stolen Youth is packed with bars on par with his following projects. If you've somehow missed out on this classic, check it out for sure. RIP to Mac <3",
