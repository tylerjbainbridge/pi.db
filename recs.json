He’s still super low key but his product is getting better and better with age and I feel any day now someone that is in some sort of position to elevate his talent more is about to come. But in the meantime I love it that he’s underground, he’s doing his thing! It’s hard to find original good content with fuck all views these days haha here is one of his new videos below and I believe that his new album will be out mid July which I can’t wait for. BEACH BOY!!! Turn that shit up and share it with ya neighbors. Oh yeah he also produces, masters and edits all his work. Unreal!</p>",

Her debut combines the baroque vocal style of 70s songwriters with lo-fi hypnagogic pop to create a lush, melancholy, beautiful, and melodic sound that I really love.

He meets her when he’s 22 and falls in mystical love at first sight with her. Like many powerful novels, it’s a book of longing. What von Hardenberg really longs for however isn’t Sophie, but the “blue flower” he’s writing about. Some lines from the story he reads aloud:\n\n“I have no craving to be rich, but I long to see the blue flower. It lies incessantly at my heart, and I can imagine and think about nothing else. Never did I feel like this before. It is as if until now I had been dreaming, or as if sleep had carried me into another world.”\n\nThe blue flower is what he’s been searching for his entire life but cannot find, will never find.\n\nWhat it represents is not explained. It might be understood as a perfect moment of transcendental joy; or the Great Beauty, or the writing that gives meaning to life, the hope, which destroys us, the trembling, skipping longing for the infinite. The flower is different for all of us. The blue has never been seen. We could do with more vaulting romanticism I feel.\n\n“The universe, after all,” thinks Friedrich, “is within us.”",

Another thing that most people don't know is that you should keep your wicks trimmed so that the flame doesn't get too big. This will lead to black flames which will stain the side of the glass.

If you get a pineapple at the store and cut it into not-very-big chunks, and then you put them in a bowl covered in saran wrap in the fridge, every time you open the fridge to get something you can stick your fingers in there and grab a perfectly cold, delicious, and sweet chunk of pineapple to shove in your mouth.

Gentaro, now 10 years old, and Kintaro, now 2 years old. Their mother is Genki, 36, and is an amazing mother. My friend Timmy and I have sent each other videos of them literally every single day since 2019, and have watched Kintaro grow from a useless baby into a little rascal who can hold his own against his big brother Gentaro. Momotaro grew up without a father, and watching him  learn the ropes of fatherhood with Kintaro was one of the most beautiful character arc’s I’ve ever seen. I strongly urge you tp follow accounts related to the Momotaro family and watch videos of them on Youtube. Please be nice as this is a subject dear to my heart.",

As it turns out, the recipe is as easy as advertised, and more delicious than I imagined. It’s so basic but so good, one of those recipes that takes hours to complete but only actually requires hands-on interaction or attention for minutes. Since my first try, I’ve made a no-knead loaf maybe 10 times and have started to experiment with different varieties (honey oat 😍).

This is one of those high school curriculum books that a lot of people have “read” but most of them haven’t really read it. This book is an anti-war book without being an in-your-face anti-war book. Written by a German soldier from WWI, about German soldiers in WWI, it’s real and HARSH. The contrast of what these young teens expected when enlisting (heroism, glory!) to what they really experience (disease, death, trench foot) is shocking and ultimately very sad.

He used to pick me up from the mall in eighth grade blasting Pharaoh Sanders or Maynard Ferguson, and when I got in, instead of turning it down, he would turn it up and say, “LISTEN TO THIS, MOUSE!!! JEEZ!!” Anyways: I first fell in love with Albert Ayler when I saw the 2013 Whitney exhibition Blues for Smoke, and on the ground floor--this is when the museum was still in the Breuer--they were playing this beautiful film of Ayler performing “Spirits Rejoice”--I think on French television. It’s very bizarre, very classic Ayler--it starts and stops multiple times, it mocks its source material, it discharges it into ecstasy. He’s like...the Herodotus of jazz. You can hear Louis Armstrong as much as you can hear Pharaoh Sanders. Ayler had one of the most fascinating lives. It was far too short: he died at 34, and there were rumors for decades that the mafia murdered him by tying him to a jukebox and throwing it into the East River. \n\nWhere to start? Well, his version of “On Green Dolphin Street” is one of the craziest things you’ll ever hear. Same goes with “Summertime.” And his live recordings are W-I-L-D: try “Live At Greenwich Village.” You can practically hear the paint peeling off the walls during “Truth Is Marching In.”\n\nI think there’s this idea that free jazz was somehow inevitable, the same way that Abstract Expressionism was--that it was simply the logical endpoint of the art form. I don’t think that’s quite right. There’s an album called The Albert Ayler Story, which is like an audio documentary and which I also recommend a lot, in which there are lots of interviews with Ayler and friends, plus formative recordings. And his drummer Milford Graves talks how there was a movement in the 1960s to stop jazz music--specifically Pharaoh and Sun-Ra and Ayler--because the musicians were too involved in political activism. Critics said it had nothing to do with the music. But to Graves, this free or avant-garde jazz was always about political progress, because it allows you to have “abstract thoughts” that you later “condense” into something “more logical.” He says of the work he was making and would have continued to make with Ayler, who died in 1970: “I think the music was going to direct people into another area of consciousness.” That’s what was lost when Ayler died. Whereas in something like pop music, “you’re constantly moving around in a circle, where there’s no kind of opening out. You’re caught.” Isn’t that fascinating?",

I’ve had a hard time with reading since quarantine, I think it has something to do with an exorbitant amount of screen time destroying what was left of my spreading diminished attention span. I trudged through book after book this past year not being able to sink my teeth into anything until I found Parable of the Sower. This book has made me fall in love with reading again. Instead of rewatching the Sopranos for the millionth time, I look forward to my time each day with the book’s chronicler, Lauren Olamina, and her Earthseed musings. A novel fraught with dystopia that feels more like today’s news than the science fiction label it got when published in 1993. I haven’t finished it quite yet, but I have been telling everyone they should read it, truly inspiring and makes me want to approach each day with more empathy and hope no matter how much despair we are hit with each day.

I haven’t finished it quite yet, but I have been telling everyone they should read it, truly inspiring and makes me want to approach each day with more empathy and hope no matter how much despair we are hit with each day. God is Change.</p>",

Eventually I was led into a tiny cubicle where hot glass vases were suctioned on to my back for ten minutes in order to move my chi( ?? ) After the treatment was over I began a plethora of google searching to understand what magic had just been enacted upon my mortal corpse. I’m still not quite sure what cupping is suppose to do but it did leave chic little octopus kiss-esk bruises on my back which make everyone think I’m an athlete.&nbsp;</p>",

I got breakfast with someone the other day and by breakfast I mean I went and got a chocolate chip cookie across the street while they ordered a carob acai bowl from Dimes. Curious and enamored with the stylish plating of the acai, I asked for a cheeky bite. Needless to say, I was delighted. It was sugary sweet and refreshing, but was disguised in a health fad facade. The next day I got my very own acai bowl, which was too big and I couldn’t finish it, (cookie breakfast fit much easier on an adderall stomach) So I stuffed it in my fridge to munch on later. To my surprise the bowl congealed during its refrigerated hours into a delicious mush like gruel of granola and almond butter and fruit. I was comforted by the baby food esk consistency of the concoction, charmed by the banana now coated in toppings, my palette purred at the way the now frozen almond butter was washed down by the melted acai.

I recently started spending weekend days strolling into a new used book store in the Lower East Side called <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sweetpicklebooks/\">Sweet Pickle Books</a>. The store has become a comforting place to make a quick cheap purchase for me, and also my go-to store for presents. Every time I go in there I find myself picking up books with the coolest names or covers and just buying them hoping I’ll like them. I’m currently reading J.G. Ballard’s <em>Super-Cannes</em> which I probably would have never even known about had I not stumbled upon it and thought the cover looked cool. I suggest this method for branching out from your usual genres or authors.&nbsp;</p>",

It made me wonder if they were always meant for each other, or just two old dogs from a bygone era trying to make sense of the new and confusing world of food. Plus, the handmade artwork is cute.

I have never even attempted a recipe out of this book but I love it a lot. Brooks is the chef behind NY fav veggie spot Superiority Burger, and he cut his teeth for years as one of the cities great pastry chefs. I love this book because it’s extremely readable. In between insane Michelin-level recipes, he’ll have stories about his band Born Against (a band I enjoyed in high school!) touring across the world, or just Brooks letting one of his employees share a recipe for biscuits instead of making it all about him. It’s not taking a cookbook deal as the opportunity to change his life and become the next Ottolenghi, he basically made a hardcover zine about his story and how he got to where he is. If you have someone in your life who grew up around punk music and is now old, get them this book. They’ll form a bond with it, even if they don’t know what a Kouign-Amann is. Also, the photography and graphic design are refreshingly honest. ",

I got this blade as a gift from my friend Andre, and it never left my drawer. There’s good clearance between the handle and the blade so people with larger hands or fat fingers will have room to chop, the tip is rounded so when you’re slicing an avocado while it’s still in it’s skin, you won’t cut your hand open, spilling blood on your eggs, and there even a hole punched in the tip if you’re the kind of person who likes hanging things on the wall. Whenever I bring my knives in to get sharpened, this Mac blade is the only one that the sharpener man feels compelled to compliment, a knifeman’s knife if you will. Also, at a hundred bucks, it’s perfect for your daily driver knife, you won’t feel the need to baby it like some hand-pounded tech bro carbon steel with a dragon engraved in the handle.",

It’s straightforward ambient music that you could find from any old Eno on the shelf, but Bib’s blend of piano, pads, and strings just really put me at ease. I also always loved the juxtaposition of the artwork and title for such a calm and beautiful record.

It’s been rewarding to push myself to share more of what I’ve learned over my 10 years in the wine biz and get over my imposter syndrome.&nbsp;</p>",

Is he talking about his recreational drug use or the passing of his father - who died from a blood clot when he was 11 years old - or his wife Kate Radley's father, who died of cancer? Probably all three. Ashcroft still plays solo but doesn't perform this song. This is the best version I have ever found online—a masterpiece. ",

The plot here focuses on the 3 people vacationing in this villa, 2 friends Adrien & Daniel, and an unwelcome guest Haydée — dubbed the collector of men. Told from Adrien's perspective, you get to experience his mental contradictions first-hand as he battles through what he says he wants, and what you, as a viewer, know he wants. Éric Rohmer’s La Collectionneuse is a great character study, with the excellent bonus of being beautifully shot and extremely vibey.",

Like Bake Off, there are potters from all walks of life who compete weekly for the title of Top Potter. I’m only two seasons in but it’s been a fun introduction to some of the different styles and techniques in pottery and the soundtrack is killer too.",

I’ve switched over to dried mango, coconut, and other fruit from TJs, but couldn’t resist this candied Yuzu when I came across it. Yuzu has such a vibrant citrus flavor that when candied, lends some sweetness to an otherwise bitter rind, resulting in a beautiful depth and zestful flavor.

I fell in love with Sandra years ago watching Without You I’m Nothing, the film version of her hit one-woman broadway show from 1990. I ended up watching it 2 times over my holiday break, my mind blown a little bit more each time. Sandra’s patented mix of social commentary and cabaret is unlike anything else, and Without You I Am Nothing is just as relevant now, perhaps even more so, than it was in 1990.

Anyway, my mom got me the Juicy suit, and it was so comfortable and so flattering that I finally understood the hype. I’ve worn it sparingly throughout the years, so it’s still in mint condition (lol) but I’ve been wearing it more this year because it makes me feel sexy and deluxe.

I think I have read each post all about 2x over, even my boyfriend’s ex-girlfriend’s!

Clémence visits women in their homes, takes pictures, and asks their recommendations on what to read, what to cook, where to eat, and just general insider tips. <a href=\"http://www.passerbuys.com/profiles/lauren-servideo?rq=lauren%20servideo\">Here is mine</a>, for the curious. I am extremely nosy and I am regularly asking “where did you get that?” I am obsessed with other people’s apartments and their drinkware and why they chose rye over bourbon. I think I have read each post all about 2x over, even my <a href=\"https://perfectlyimperfect.substack.com/p/25-emerson-ray-rosenthal\">boyfriend</a>’s ex-girlfriend’s! On the site, the entries can be sorted by occupation or city/neighborhood; it’s immediately clear that she hasn’t just interviewed 12 creative directors and 9 brand ambassadors. My only rule is that you can’t visit the site until you’re done reading this newsletter because that would be rude.&nbsp;</p>",

The show is basically about a bunch of young, hot people who all “suck at relationships” and are trying to find their Perfect Match: another contestant on the show, predetermined by the producers but unknown amongst themselves, who is meant to be their ideal romantic partner. I’m in it for the shitty laser effects, the snarky host Ryan Devlin, and of course, the never-ending drama. If you’re in need of a mental vacation, check out the first two seasons streaming on Netflix now.&nbsp;</p>",

No offense, but the VFX-driven spectacles of today just don’t hit when you cut your teeth on stuff from CANADA and the Directors Bureau (whose website sadly doesn’t even have their best stuff anymore). \n\nThe unique exception is director Cody Critcheloe, who goes by SSION (pronounced like the latter half of *passion*), and his new video for Yves Tumor is nothing less than what I’ve come to expect from the multihyphenate: a hyperreal vision of Los Angeles replete with larger-than-life characters who are characteristically drawn up from real life, and handmade props that belong in a museum, but I’ll settle for a gallery.

Little did I know all I needed was to hit play on a few of these flicks on Criterion, and all of my needs could be fulfilled. Rohmer’s stories follow the most lovestruck, well-vacationed characters as they wash down kisses with martinis and fill their afternoons with silly games of phonetag and delectable meals.

For years, I found myself encapsulated in the “Instagram-activism” bubble while not really understanding the context and gravity of the things I was advocating for. I had good intentions, but if someone really dug into my positions I wouldn’t have been able to back them up confidently.

It’s really important to understand how we’ve gotten here as a country in order to advocate for the future, and I encourage people to reflect on their own beliefs and their ability to defend them.

Madeline’s voice feels familiar throughout like you’ve heard the songs before while still feeling original. Good autumn record.</p>",

The second episode opens with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUn3sPJ14Mk&amp;ab_channel=KlausNomi-Topic\">“Keys of Life”</a>, and I was so taken aback by how haunting it sounded that I immediately checked out the rest of his music. My personal favorite is his ingenious cover of Hank Ballard’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgvQLTJLNCM&amp;ab_channel=KlausNomi-Topic\">“The Twist”</a> which reinvents it as this spooky opera with the sliiickest bassline.&nbsp;</p>",

I’m not traveling right now, so I have gone for something a little more civilized. Faccia Brutto is a Brooklyn-based spirits company and the fernet is perfect for sipping with some soda water after a long day. There is less alcoholic heat and more depth of flavor from this Fernet than most others. It is life-affirming after a big meal and while I drink it as a spritz you could have it on the rocks or straight. If you do decide to take it straight please understand how weird it is to do a shot alone in your house!",
