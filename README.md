# What is this??

This is a repository for all projects relating to (Perfectly Imperfect Newsletter)[https://www.perfectlyimperfect.fyi/].

Substack has no API, so to build a database of our guests, features, and recommendations I had to build web scraper to parse the data we needed.

Right now the data is used to power [search.perfectlyimperfect.fyi](https://search.perfectlyimperfect.fyi/), a powerful search for our thousands of recommendations.
And our [Discord bot](https://discord.gg/QMuPsjJgDK), which will respond with a random recommendation matching the search criteria.

There's a lot more that can be done with this data and we'll keep finding fun ways to use it :)
